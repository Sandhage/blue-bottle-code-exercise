# Blue Bottle Coding Exercise

## Installation

- clone this repository
- install bundler (http://bundler.io/)
- install Ruby 2.1 or higher
- run ```bundle install```
- run ```bundle exec rspec``` from the root of this repository

## Problem to Solve

This exercise asks you to implement a simple system to model subscribing to receive a coffee. The system should support:

- a customer subscribing to receive a coffee
- a customer cancelling a coffee subscription
- a customer pausing a coffee subscription

The ```coding_question_spec.rb``` file outlines in detail the expected behavior through the use of tests. That means when all the tests have expectations and pass, you're done! The test examples have been marked as pending with `xit` -- to make them active, just remove the `x` before the `it` in each example.

All the files you need to implement a solution are there except for one ... you'll need to implement the `Subscription` model. However, you may edit (or add) *any* files in the repository to help you solve the problem. The one exception is that you should not need to adjust the description of each test example. The rules are open-ended on purpose. We want you to use your imagination and practical decision-making to make the tests expecations pass.

The exercise should take an estimated 1-3 hours to complete.

Please use source control for your code and attempt to organize your solution into logical commits. Once complete, please send your a link to your solution repository via email (scott@bluebottlecoffee.com). Along with the code, please include a written introduction to your solution, that explains the design and implementation decisions you made and why. NOTE: If you are uncomfortable posting this as a public repository and don't have a private account, please zip up the repository send by email.

If you have any questions, want to pair with a Blue Bottle engineer, or have trouble running the specs, please let us know.
